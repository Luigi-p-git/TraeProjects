# Or reset current branch to stable version (WARNING: loses current changes)
git reset --hard v1.0-stable
```

### To see what changed since stable version:
```bash
git diff v1.0-stable

## Development Workflow

1. **Before adding new features:** Always commit current state
2. **Create feature branches:** `git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name`
3. **Tag stable versions:** Use semantic versioning (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
4. **Document changes:** Update this file with each new version

---

## Backup Strategy

This git repository serves as your local backup. For additional safety:

1. **Push to GitHub/GitLab:** (Optional) Create a remote repository
2. **Export specific versions:** Use `git archive` to create zip files
3. **Regular commits:** Commit frequently during development

## Chat Log Alternative

While we can't save chat logs directly, this git history serves as a comprehensive record of:
- What was implemented when
- The exact state of code at any point
- Ability to revert to any previous version
- Detailed commit messages explaining changes

This is actually more reliable than chat logs since it captures the exact code state!
